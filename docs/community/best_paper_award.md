Best deal.II-based papers
=========================

deal.II is used by a very large number of projects, as evidenced by
the [long list of publications using deal.II](publications.md). We
award some of these papers the "Best deal.II-based paper award" to
showcase the complexity of applications that can be realized with
deal.II. The criteria for this award are:

- Complexity of the model realized with deal.II;
- Complexity of the implementation;
- Size of the computation;
- Quality of the visualizations shown in the paper.
