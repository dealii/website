    <b>What it is</b>: A C++ software library supporting the creation of finite element codes and an open community of users and developers. ([About deal.II](about/index.md))

    <b>Mission</b>: To provide well-documented tools to build finite element codes for a broad variety of PDEs, from laptops to supercomputers. ([deal.II documentation](https://dealii.org/current/doxygen/deal.II))

    <b>Vision</b>: To create an open, inclusive, participatory community providing users and developers with a state-of-the-art, comprehensive software library that constitutes the go-to solution for all finite element problems. ([Participate in deal.II](community/index.md))

- 2025/09/30: [Best deal.II-based paper of 2024: D. Abbondanza, M. Gallo, C. M. Casciola:
"Collapse of microbubbles over an elastoplastic wall"](community/best_paper_award.md).

- 2025/07/22: **Version 9.7.0 released**:
deal.II version 9.7.0 was released today. A full list of changes can be found [here](http://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_9_6_0_and_9_7_0.html) and a long description of changes is in the manuscript [here](https://dealii.org/deal97-preprint.pdf). Download links are on the [download](current_release/download.md) page, or the [release page on github](https://github.com/dealii/dealii/releases).

- 2025/05/31: The [step-97 tutorial program](https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/step_97.html), written
by Siarhei Uzunbajakau, illustrates how to solve curl-curl problems.

- 2025/05/07: The new [step-93 tutorial program](https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/step_93.html), written
by Sam Scheuerman, demonstrates the use of degrees of freedom not associated with mesh nodes
in an optimization problem.

- 2025/03/03: **SIAM/ACM Prize in Computational Science and Engineering**:
The principal developers of deal.II were awarded the
[SIAM/ACM Prize in Computational Science and
Engineering](https://www.siam.org/programs-initiatives/prizes-awards/major-prizes-lectures/siamacm-prize-in-computational-science-and-engineering/prize-history/)
"for their highly impactful library supporting finite element
calculations. The software achieved a very high standard of software
quality and modularity by providing packaged algorithms and data
structures in a comprehensive and well-documented manner that enables
and elevates whole communities to achieve more computationally
advanced models than they could possibly otherwise." See
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv2MOoNn7Z0">here</a> for the prize lecture.
