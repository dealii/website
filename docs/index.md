The [deal.II discussion group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/dealii) (or directly via [email](mailto:dealii@googlegroups.com)) is used by developers to announce new features and by users to ask questions about how to do things with deal.II. This is also the forum to post bug reports. Archives of the "deal.II developer list" (now retired) are available at <http://groups.google.com/d/forum/dealii-developers>. Archives from the time before we started using Google Groups in 2012 can be are accessed [here (dealii mailing list)](https://dealii.org/archive/dealii/maillist.html) and [here (developers mailing list)](https://dealii.org/archive/developers/maillist.html).

The development of the library source code is done on the [github.com deal.II project](https://github.com/dealii/dealii) using Issues and Pull-Requests.

For questions or concerns that you don't want to discuss on a public mailing list feel free to write an e-mail to any of the [Principal Developers](team.md#principal-developers) directly.

We appreciate comments and suggestions on deal.II. They can be addressed to either of the addresses above, depending on their public or private nature.
